# Reporters
Newsroom Reporter plug-in projects.

## Summary
This folder contains the projects for the Newsroom Reporter plug-ins.

The Interface header, 'ireporter.h', is also included at this level for
use both by the plug-in projects and the main application.

## Qt versions
These projects were developed with, and tested under, Qt versions 5.4.2 and
5.6.2.

## Usage
Newsroom will automatically load these plug-ins on startup.  You merely need
to build them, and their output will be deposited directly into a location
where Newsroom will find them.
